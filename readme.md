# Predictive Insights into Hotel Reservations

## 📌 Overview
This project uses statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to **predict hotel booking cancellations**.  
By understanding customer **behavior**, booking patterns, and cancellation trends, the model can help hotel management:

- Minimize last-minute cancellations  
- Optimize revenue forecasting  
- Improve resource allocation and staffing  
- Enhance guest satisfaction  

The analysis covers **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, **model building**, **evaluation**, and **interpretation**.

# 🎯 Problem Statement
Hotels face significant operational and financial challenges from reservation cancellations.
The key questions addressed in this project are:
1.	Which factors influence booking cancellations the most?
2.	Can we accurately predict if a booking will be canceled?
3.	Which model balances accuracy and business priorities (precision vs. recall) best?

# Workflow
## 1.	Data Loading & Inspection
	-Imported CSV file into R
	-Checked dimensions, missing values, structure, and summary statistics
## 2.	Data Cleaning & Preparation
	-Removed irrelevant columns (IDs and redundant attributes)
	-Converted arrival_month to factor with month names
## 3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	-Univariate Analysis: Histograms, frequency tables, and bar plots for individual features
	-Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between features and booking status
	-Boxplots: Visualized numeric variables across cancellation status
## 4.	Data Splitting
	-29,000 rows for training
	-Remaining rows for testing
## 5.	Modeling
	-Logistic Regression (baseline classification model)
	-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with different decision thresholds (0.3, 0.4)
	-Naive Bayes classifier
	-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with k=7
## 6.	Model Evaluation
	-Confusion matrices
	-Accuracy and testing error rate calculation
	-Comparison of models and threshold adjustments for LDA

## 📊 Libraries Used & Purpose

### 🗄 Data Manipulation
- **base R** — Reading CSV files, indexing, subsetting, and basic data operations.

### 🎨 Visualization
- **ggplot2**  
  - Created bar charts with counts and grouped booking status.  
  - Customized legends, labels, and aesthetics.  
- **gridExtra**  
  - Arranged multiple ggplot2 plots in grid layouts.  
- **Base plotting functions**  
  - Created histograms, barplots, and boxplots with labeled counts and custom colors.

### 🤖 Statistical & Machine Learning
- **MASS**  
  - `lda()` function for Linear Discriminant Analysis.  
- **e1071**  
  - `naiveBayes()` for Naive Bayes classification.  
- **class**  
  - `knn()` for K-Nearest Neighbors classification.  
- **stats**  
  - `glm()` for Logistic Regression.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Hotel Reservations Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset)  
- **Observations**: 36,275  
- **Features**: 19 columns (**11 used** after preprocessing)  
- **Response Variable**: `booking_status`  
  - `"Canceled"`  
  - `"Not_Canceled"`  

### 🏷 Predictors Used
- `no_of_adults`  
- `no_of_children`  
- `no_of_weekend_nights`  
- `no_of_week_nights`  
- `type_of_meal_plan` *(categorical)*  
- `room_type_reserved` *(categorical)*  
- `lead_time`  
- `arrival_month` *(categorical)*  
- `market_segment_type` *(categorical)*  
- `avg_price_per_room`  
- `no_of_special_requests`  

### 🗑 Dropped Features & Rationale
- **Booking ID** — Unique identifier, no predictive power  
- **Required car parking space** — Low variance, weak correlation  
- **Arrival year** — Single/few values only  
- **Arrival date** — Redundant with arrival month  
- **Repeated guest** — Strong imbalance in distribution  
- **No of previous cancellations** — Not representative for most customers  
- **No of previous bookings not canceled** — Similar to above  

________________________________________
## 🛠 Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values — **none found**  
- Converted `arrival_month` from numeric (1–12) → categorical (Jan–Dec)  
- Removed irrelevant columns  
- Split dataset:  
  - **Training set**: 29,000 observations (~80%)  
  - **Test set**: 7,275 observations (~20%)  
- Scaled numeric predictors for **KNN** to ensure fair distance calculations

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔍 Key Insights
- **Seasonality**: Aug–Oct had the highest bookings.  
- **Room Preferences**: Room Type 1 dominated reservations.  
- **Guests**: Most bookings had 2 adults, no children.  
- **Special Requests**: Bookings with at least 1 special request were more often canceled.  
- **Lead Time**: Longer lead times were associated with higher cancellations.  
- **Meal Plans**: Meal plan 1 was most common.  
- **Market Segments**: Online bookings formed the majority.  

### 📈 Example EDA Visualizations
- **Histograms** for numeric features (lead time, price, nights)  
- **Barplots** for categorical variables (room type, market segment)  
- **Boxplots** comparing numerical predictors across booking status

# 🤖 Modeling Approach
Four models were tested, plus variations in LDA decision thresholds:
Model	                                   Description
Logistic Regression	                       Linear classifier using log-odds transformation
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)	       Projects data to maximize class separation
Naive Bayes	                               Probabilistic model assuming feature independence
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	               Classifies based on nearest neighbors in feature space

Logistic Reg.	79.81%	73.56%	    60.75%	66.55%
LDA	            79.08%	73.27%	    57.80%	64.62%
LDA (0.3)	    77.88%	63.82%	    76.42%	69.56%
LDA (0.4)	    79.22%	69.22%	    66.86%	68.02%
Naive Bayes	    76.36%	69.19%	    51.35%	58.95%
KNN (k=7)	    84.65%	79.43%	    72.27%	75.68%

# Key Findings
•	KNN performed best overall (Accuracy 84.65%).
•	LDA (0.3) gave the best recall (good for catching potential cancellations).
•	Precision focus → KNN was preferred to reduce false positives.
# Evaluation Criteria
•	Precision priority: Minimize false positives (predicting “Canceled” when it’s actually “Not_Canceled”).
•	Recall consideration: Useful if we want to capture as many true cancellations as possible.
•	Chosen Model: KNN for its superior precision, accuracy, and F1-score.
